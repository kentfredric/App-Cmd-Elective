NAME
    App::Cmd::Elective - load only ::Command::* from a whitelist

VERSION
    version 0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
    If you have an existing App which uses App::Cmd and you want to add
    whitelist only support, a simple change is required:

        diff:

        -use App::Cmd::Setup -app
        +use App::Cmd::Elective -app

        +sub app_commands {
        +   qw( foo bar )
        +}

    The function "app_commands" returns a list of commandlets to load. ( In
    additional to any defaults provided by App::Cmd ).

    Note: Note these are NOT nessecarily the same as the CLI command names,
    but these are the "providing module" names, which are expanded based
    upon the value of "plugin_search_path", and then the resulting command
    name is based on the individual modules values of "command_names"

    Otherwise, except for this minor difference, usage should be identical
    to that of App::Cmd's standard behaviour
